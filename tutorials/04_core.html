In this tutorial you will learn how to load and display images on the canvas.
Loading and displaying images requires an additional step that our previous 
tutorials did not require. A new image object has to be created that will allow
us to draw images onto our canvas. Once the image is configured and ready for 
use, we display the image by calling the image object method "draw". This draw
method can take several parameters.

	//Example new image object.
	myimage=new image('logo.png');

	//Method to draw an image onto the canvas.
	.draw(dst,posx,posy,alpha,rot,width,height)
	
	//Draw Method Expanded Explanation
	.draw(
		dst,  //This parameter should be the name of your canvas object.	
		posx, //Horizontal Starting Point of where to load the image.
		posy, //Vertical Starting Point of where to load the image.
		alpha,//Optionally declare image alpha.
		rot,  //Optionally rotate the image.
		width,//Optionally declare image width.
		height//Optionally declare image height.
	)

(Tip: Image objects also have a useful "setmidhandle" method which sets the
handle of the image to be the center rather than the top left 0,0 position.
The setmidhandle method should be called in init while new image objects should
be created before init. This is because creating a new image object in init 
and then immediately calling the setmidhandle method on the new object can fail
due to the fact the image may not have yet loaded. It is a better practice to 
declare all images before init, and then working on them later.)
