In this tutorial you will learn how to create simple quads on a canvas.
A quad is a shape with four vertices such as a square or a rectangle.

To create quads, we call the quad method from the canvas object.
The quads long method takes nine parameters. The first 8 parameters plot
coordinates on the canvas while the last specifies color.
The quad method also has a shorthand version which allows for you to quickly
specify a starting point in the x,y axis followed by a width and height for your
quad. Both versions are explained in more detail below.
			
	.quad(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,x4,y4,color) //Long Version
	.quad(x1,y1,width,height,color)	//Short Version
	
	//Long Version Expanded Explanation
	.quad(	
		x1,y1, //Quad Corner 1
                x2,y2, //Quad Corner 2
		x3,y3, //Quad Corner 3
		x4,y4, //Quad Corner 4
		color  //Quad Color 
	)

	//Short Version Expanded Explanation
	.quad(
		x1, 	//Horizontal Starting point for Quad
		y1, 	//Vertical Starting point for Quad.
		width,	//Width of Quad.
		height, //Height of Quad.
		color,	//Color of Quad.
	)
