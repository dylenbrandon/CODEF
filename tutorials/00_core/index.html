FILE : 00_core

In this tutorial you will learn how to create a canvas by creating a new canvas object :
	main=new canvas(640,480,"main"); //Example canvas object.

As can be seen in the following example, only the WIDTH and HEIGHT of your 
canvas size is required to create a canvas. Optionally, you can pass
a third parameter to your new canvas object which will set the ID of the created DIV element.
If a third parameter is not set, the DIV element for the canvas will be created offscreen.
(Tip: Not showing the canvas may be useful for some CODEF effects.) 

The canvas function returns an object with some nice functions :
	.clear() = This function clears the canvas
	.fill(color) = This function fills the entire canvas with a specified color.
	
Reminder: The codef core script must be loaded to use codef! Don't forget it.
