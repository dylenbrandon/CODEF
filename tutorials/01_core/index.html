FILE : 01_core

In this tutorial you will learn how to create simple lines on a canvas.

As seen in the previous tutorial, canvas provides access to various methods.
Another method returned by the canvas object is the line method.

	.line(x1,y1,x2,y2,width,color)

The line method allows us to use x,y coordinates to draw lines on the canvas.
The x1 and y1 parameters of the line method declare our line starting point.
The x2 and y2 parameters of the line method declare our line ending point.
The width parameter declares line thickness and the last parameter the line color.
