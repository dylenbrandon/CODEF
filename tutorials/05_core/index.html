FILE : 05_core

In this tutorial you will learn basic animation using the example from 04_core.
Our animation will bounce our image from one side of the canvas to the other.
When our image touches either side of the canvas, it will change direction.
To accomplish this, we declare two 'if statements' that detect the image location.
One if statement will determine if the image has reached the end of the canvas.
Another if statement will determine if the image has reached the beginning.
When either statement is true, the travel direction will be switched accordingly.
The image travel direction is determined with a positive or negative coordinate.

	//It will move to the right if positive, or to the left if negative.
